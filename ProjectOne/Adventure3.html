                So after the events of the previous day Wimiky was now more determined than ever 
            to have the very first day of college of all times.  He began his plan the night before.
            This time he will be so together that nobody,not even a sixth-year senior, would be able to tell
            that he's just a freshman.  This is gonna be his best first day ever.
            <br>

                The night before his plan for the smoothest first day ever began.  His cousin, Melody,
            was just a year older and also attended Victoria University. Having heard through the grapevine,
            from his mom to her mom to her, about what happened to his food she had a gift for him. She told
            him to come to her room, just four floors up from his, and get her old mini-fridge since she 
            got a new one from her dad.  Not only did she give him that but also food. So along with this surprise
            and the box he got from his mom he had enpught for an acceptable breakfast.  His next move was 
            to get his clothes ready. So he was off to bed at 11:00 and up at 6:30. With the quick
            dash to the bathroom, he didnt want to rush, Wimiky took about 45 minutes to complete his morning
            routine and was out front of hids dorm waiting for the Puma Shuttle.

                Class time so far was great. None of the syllabus seemed undoable and all of the professors 
            seemed reallh approachable for help. Now as he walked up to The Henry Center of The Sciences
            he began to feel sick amd nervous.  he knew that he was approaching the one class that 
            was the only class he ever earned a "C"  during high school. Oh how he thought of vectors and 
            planes. How he wished he didnt have to take this class but the CS department requires him to take it.
            he asked himself "What will I use Physics for?" As he st in the large audotorium style 
            classroom he watched as others came in laughing and talking as if they were so sure 
            the had this class.  He then noticed a small frail older man standing by the desk at the front
            as if he was waiting for the class to calm down. Once it did he bgan to talk "Good afternoon I am Dr.
            Smith.  Welcome to Physics 1." 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> He then spent the next 45 minutes going through the syllabus,
            what topics would be discussed this semster, and informing of the help center before dismissing 
            for the day.  Leaving the lectue he felt really good about that portion of the course. Only 
            thing now the lab portion. As he waited outside the door his mind went back to that day 
            at Deerfield High and the experiment in physics that still makes him shutter. Then when 
            the door opened he saw Dr. Smithsatnding there greeting the eight students who signed
            up for this lab. Dr. Smith made this very short speech that let Wimiky know he had been 
            worrying for nothing. "On every Tuesday I will do an experiment in class. All you all have to do
            is to take notes of it so you can spend the first ten minutes of lab writting a summary and we 
            leave for the day."
