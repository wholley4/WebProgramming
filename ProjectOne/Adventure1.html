      <strong>
        <p>
                Wimiky Hohaho is 18 years old and is currently looking at the ceiling of his dorm 
            room at Victoria University.  He's super excited to be starting his college career.
            So here he was in the middle of Alatami, Victoria and all on his own. He just got to get
            through his first day of class.

                So he's up and thinking about what may be ahead for the day. First thinghe needs his 
            breakfast. Going to the kitchen he shares with his five dorm mates he goes for his assigned
            cabinet. When he opens it he sees all his snacks have been eaten. He now knows why there's a
            lock on all of the cabinets. Disappointed and still hungry he rushes back to his room
            to grab his shower gear so he could grab something from downstairs in the dinning hall.
            As he gets to the bathroom on his side of the dorm room he greets a dorm mate leaving but noticing
            he was eating the same brand of granola bars that he had. After showering and dressing he heads 
            out the door to wait for the elevator. He smiles at a young lady waiting as well. Once down stairs
            he heads over to the dinning area and gets a bowl of fruit and some bacon. Just as he sitd down
            he looks at his watch and notices he only has ten  inutes until class start.

                Just as he gets out to the shuttle stop it pulls off on him. Looking down at his watch again
            he lets out a large sigh, throw his food away, and akes off running uphill towards the classroom 
            building. Half a mile and 6 minutes late he stands outside the building.  Rushing in he bumps 
            into a friend from home. Not having time to speak he waves at her and runs up the four fleights
            of stairs. He finds the classrom and sees he is now a full 20 minutes late so he takes a seat at the back.
            When class is overhe goes down toask the professor "What's the recommnded calculator for the class?"
            With a puzzled look he asks Wimiky "Are you sure you're in the right class?" Pulling out his 
            phone to look at his schedule he says " Pre-Calculus Tuesday and Thursday Danglale Hall 8:00-9:30."
            With a big grin on his face the professor says "Today is Monday."
