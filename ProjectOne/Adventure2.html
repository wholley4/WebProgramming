      <strong>
        <p>
            All ready for the world Wimiky decides he takes his future career seriously now.
        The first thing he figured was getting an internship at a tech company. Luckily he had already
        did that the spring before. Now that getting the internship has been proquired its time he
        wowed them and showed them why he's "D Amazing CS Student".

            Walking up to the white desk in the lobby Wimiky told the receptionist his name.
        Without even looking up she gave him his ID badge and said "Go to the 10th floor."
        When he stepped off he saw a big open room with 12 desks and a big sign that read "INTERNS" so 
        he knew he was in the right place. Before he could ask where to sit his stuff an older
        lady walked up and said "wimiky sit your bag by the door. Then go to the conference room on the 
        13th floor. They're waiting on you."

            As he walked towards the elevatolr he thought to himself that he mustve made a
        super impression during his interview. He wondered what type ofultra cool project 
        would he be working on. He imagined them offering him a job as soon as he 
        walked in the room. As he walked in the confrence room a tall male told him "Take everybody's
        order then go get our coffee."
